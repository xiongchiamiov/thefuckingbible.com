Many Christians have heard passages of the Bible so many times they lose the
ability to reparse them - it's just too familiar.  This is a problem if you're
trying to learn new things and question your understanding of the text.

One of the best ways to fight this is to read radical rephrasings.  The Message
is a fantastic resource for this.

**The Fucking Bible** is another attempt in that same direction.  I do not have
the qualifications to create a full paraphrase of my own, but my hope is that
my unusually profane commentary can shock you into thinking about this most
important work in a new light.
